# 📌 React Native Todo List
A lightweight and intentionally minimalistic Todo List application built with React Native and Expo. The app is designed to be extremely fast, responsive, and distraction‑free by avoiding unnecessary features that slow down most task managers.

## ⚡ Performance‑Focused by Design
This application is deliberately created without unnecessary or bloated functionality. By keeping the feature set minimal, the app achieves:
- instant startup
- exceptional responsiveness
- smooth performance even on older devices
- a clean and focused user experience
The goal is simple: to outperform other todo apps in speed by doing only what truly matters.

## 📦 Local Data Storage
All user‑entered data is stored locally on the device’s internal memory. This ensures:
- maximum speed
- complete privacy
- no external servers or cloud syncing
However, because the data is stored locally, it may be lost if the device storage becomes corrupted, reset, or damaged.

## 🌙 Dark Mode Design
The entire interface is built in a dark theme (Dark Mode) using soft, eye‑friendly colors. This design approach provides:
- reduced eye strain
- comfortable long‑term use
- a modern and elegant visual style
- better usability in low‑light environments
